Subject: [PATCH] receive-pack fsck object warnings are non-fatal

Makes git-unpack-objects --strict, and git-index-pack --strict treat
fsck_object() warnings as non-fatal and omits writing them to stderr
as error messages completely. Currently, warnings cause git-receive-pack
to reject pushes when receive.fsckObjects is set.

All existing warnings come from fsck_tree(). They are:

 - contains full pathnames
 - contains empty pathname
 - contains zero-padded file modes
 - contains bad file modes

fsck.c defines a default fsck_error_function() callback that's called by the
individual fsck_XXX functions to report errors and warnings. It always returns
1 regardless of severity. The default callback is actually only used from
git-unpack-objects and git-index-pack to implement the --strict checks. The
git-fsck builtin defines its own error callback and returns 0 for warnings.
This change modifies the default callback to use the same behavior as the
git-fsck command and also omits the error message output.
